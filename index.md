We're designing the new future.

We know the world is changing, and we're building the future we want.

We believe in humans and family over greed and [hoarding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoarding_(economics)).

We are compassionate and peaceful.

We know that the old is being replaced by the new.

It is not **us** vs **them**, it is us replacing them naturally and easily over time, because that is how time works.ðŸ˜‚

It is not **new** vs **old**, it is new replacing old naturally and easily over time, because that is how time works.ðŸ˜‚

We know technology is powerful, and we use it to relax, to find peace, to build community, and to protect us from abuse and [coercion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coercion).

Weâ€™ve learned everything that's important naturally and easily from YouTube, and we know that we can naturally and easily imagine the future we want.

Letâ€™s paint a picture of that new future. Together.

And then build it.
